# Employee Attrition Prediction Project üìä

## Overview ‚ÑπÔ∏è

This project aims to predict employee attrition using machine learning techniques. Employee attrition refers to the phenomenon of employees leaving an organization, voluntarily or involuntarily. By analyzing various factors related to employees, such as demographics, job roles, job satisfaction, and work-life balance, we can build models to predict which employees are more likely to leave the company.

## Dataset üìë

The dataset used for this project contains information about employees, including their age, daily rate, job role, marital status, etc. The target variable is "Attrition," which indicates whether an employee has left the company or not. The dataset consists of 1470 observations and 34 features.

## Approach üõ†Ô∏è

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset undergoes preprocessing steps such as encoding categorical variables, splitting features and target variable, and scaling numerical features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: EDA is performed to gain insights into the dataset and understand the relationships between different variables. Visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and scatter plots are used to explore the distribution and correlation of features.

3. **Modeling**: Various machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest Classifier and XGBoost Classifier are trained on the dataset to predict employee attrition. The models are evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

4. **Prediction and Evaluation**: The trained models are used to predict employee attrition on the test set, and classification reports are generated to evaluate the performance of the models.

## Results üìà

The Random Forest Classifier achieved an accuracy of XX%, precision of XX%, recall of XX%, and F1-score of XX% on the test set.

The XGBoost Classifier achieved an accuracy of XX%, precision of XX%, recall of XX%, and F1-score of XX% on the test set.

## Conclusion üéâ

Employee attrition prediction is a crucial task for organizations to identify potential turnover risks and take proactive measures to retain valuable employees. By leveraging machine learning techniques and analyzing various factors influencing attrition, organizations can optimize their human resources management strategies and improve employee retention rates.
